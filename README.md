# NgIotSynthDemo

A simple synth demo, with built-in MIDI controller. This is not perfect, I've used it with a IoT board for midi input; see the
`services/pipeline/inputs/midi-input.service.ts for details on hooking up your own midi controller. If you have a touch-screen
laptop (Surface Book, etc) you can play the keyboard onscreen with your fingers. It is multi-touch enabled.

This was updated to version 6 of Angular and 6 of RxJS in August 2018.

Enjoy!
